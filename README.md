## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to utilize JavScript for validation, especially built-in constraint validation.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to learn regex, and its applications for form validation.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Docs on client-side validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation) - This helped me with HTML and JavaScript validation. It is very clear and incredibly useful.
- [MDN Docs on constraint validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Constraint_validation) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand constraint validation. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
